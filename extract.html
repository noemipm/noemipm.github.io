<h1>Developer, Cyclist, Curious and Globetrotting</h1>
 
<p>My most recent interest is within the technology world. I have grown a strong interest in web development, and here I continue studying to learn everything I can about it and further my knowledge.</p>
 
<h2>Why?</h2>
 
<p>After going through the <strong>Adalab</strong> program, I acquired the necessary skills to work as a junior web developer, including knowledge in HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
